# Algorithms
this repo will have basic sorting algorithms and data structures code

# SORTING ALGORITMS
  1. Bubble Sort - time complexity is O(n^2)
  2. Selction Sort - time complexity is O(n^2)
  3. Insertion Sort - Whenever we move element, make sure left side of the elements should be sorted and also time complexity is O(n) when you have most of the elements are sorted- O(n^2)

# Time Complexity
 
 A. Search  
  1. UnOrdered List  
    a. Best case, knowing the index of the element that you then it is O(1)    
    b. Worst case, O(n)
  
  2. Ordered List 
    a. O(log^n base2)
    
 B. Insertion/Deletion 
  1. Ordered list  
    a. Worst case, O(n)    
    b. Best case, O(1)
