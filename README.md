# Algorithms
this repo will have basic sorting algorithms and data structures code
SORTING ALGORITMS
  1. Bubble Sort - time complexity is O(n^2)
  2. Selction Sort - time complexity is O(n^2)
  3. Insertion Sort - Whenever we move element, make sure left side of the elements should be sorted and also time complexity is O(n) when you have most of the elements are sorted- O(n^2)
