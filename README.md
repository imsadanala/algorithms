# algorithms
this repo will have basic sorting algorithms and data structures code
SORTING ALGORITMS
  1. Bubble Sort - O(square(n)
  2. Selction Sort - O(square(n)
  3. Insertion Sort - Whenever we move element, make sure left side of the elements should be sorted and also time complexity is (O) when you have most of the elements are sorted- O(square(n)
